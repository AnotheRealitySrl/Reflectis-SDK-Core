## v11.1.1

### Fixed

- Fixed package version in package.json

## v11.1.0

### Added

- Platform: added signature for `LoadDefaultEvent` method in `IReflectisApplicationManager`.

## v11.0.0

### Changed

- Changed `RuntimePlatform` enum into `ESupportedPlatform` and specified Android in VR.

### Added

- New WebSocket module, with an interface system that allows to implement a custom socket communication.
- New ChatBot module, with an interface system that allows to implement communication with AI services and implement a chatbot.
- Networking: the `Networking System` is exposing the boolean property `LocalPlayerId`. This read-only property returns the player ID (i.e. Photon's actor number) of the local player. Player ID is a unique identifier for the user in the current shard context.
- ClientModels: added supported platform data to `CMEnvironment`
- Interaction: Submesh generation in explodable objects is now cached, to reduce computational load.
- Utilities: added `RenameAttribute` which can be used to rename inspector fields.
- Utilities: added awaitable `DownloadImageAsync` method in `ImageDownlaoder` utility script.

### Removed

- Avatar: removed `OnBeforeIstantiation` callback, changed `AvatarData` structure to include prefab.

## v10.1.0

### Added

- Networking: added a new bool field `isShardClosed` to ping method data (`IClientModelSystem.PingMyOnlinePresence`), online user presence classes (`CMOnlinePresence` and `OnlinePresenceDTO`)and shard data class (`CMShard`). These fields are used to implement shard closing: the flag is checked when Reflectis client has to detect if an event shard is joinable or a new one should be created and joined.
- Networking: new `Networking System` module. This will be used to expose events and behaviours related to Photon's networking in the Reflectis context.
- Networking: the `Networking System` is hosting the events `OtherPlayerJoinedShard` and `OtherPlayerLeftShard`, that can be used to detect players entering/leaving the Reflectis event where the local player is currently staying. These events have two integer parameters, respectively the User ID (from the Reflectis profile) and the actor number of the user that just entered/left the shard.
- Networking: the `Networking System` is exposing the methods `OpenCurrentShard` and `CloseCurrentShard`. These can be used to respectively open or close the shard where the local player is. A closed shard will prevent other player from joining it, like if the shard has reached max capacity. In case the shard event is set as "unlimited", player entering after the shard has been closed will just land in a new shard.
- Networking: the `Networking System` is exposing the boolean property `IsCurrentShardOpen`. This read-only property returns true if the current shard is open, false if the current shard is closed.
- Added signature for the `LoadEvent` method in `IReflectisApplicationManager` interface. This will allow accessing the implemented method via `Reflectis.SDK.ApplicationManagement` module.

- Avatars: added new method `EnableOtherAvatarsMeshes`. It can be used to hide/show other player's avatars.

The key for each entry in the dictionary is the actor number of the player controlling the related avatar.
