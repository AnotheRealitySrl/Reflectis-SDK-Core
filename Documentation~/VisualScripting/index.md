# Visual scripting custom nodes with data

The visual scripting nodes generated by the classes are unique at the instance level. However, they are placed within graphs, which can be distributed throughout the scene. The node instance remains the same for Unity and is unique per graph, even if the graph itself is duplicated. The most common case involves non-embedded graphs.

For Unity, there is only one node per graph, but for us developers, it's often much more intuitive to think of it as unique per graph, even if that graph is used multiple times throughout the project.

For this reason, two abstract classes have been created in the Reflectis SDK Core (one for base units and one for event units) that allow storing unique data per node in a graphâ€”even when the graph is reused (InstanceDataEventUnit and InstanceDataUnit).

Using these classes is recommended when creating nodes that rely on setup data, especially when that data may vary between graph instances.

Additionally, classes have been created to support the creation of nodes tied to Action or UnityEvent, which can be inserted and invoked by other objects (UnityEventUnit and ActionEventUnit).
